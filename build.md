# Harite Build Guide

## Issues and Improvements

For any known issues and improvements please see the repo's [issues](https://github.com/dlip/harite/issues)

## BOM

- 2 x RP2040-Zero controller with headers 2.5mm height
- 2 x Cirque 40mm Trackpads TM040040-2024-302 flat overlay (optional)
  - If you are able to test the no cirque case please let me know if it was successful
- 2 x HRO TYPE-C-31-M-12 USB C female ports
- 10 x SKRHADE010 5-way switches
- 50 x 1N4148 SOD-123 Diodes
- 1 x USB-C to USB-C cable to connect halves
- 1 x USB-C to USB-A/C cable to connect to pc
- 10 x M2 5mm flat head screws for base

- 3D printed Case and joystick caps - the STLs are in the [printables](./printables) folder. If you want to modify anything, this is the [Onshape Project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b93bd8dc5e080887b7a35bc8/w/2fa13694cc5562fc6be45ae5/e/f3942d0fbdb4c55aacbbd3d2)
- Blu-tack or similar to stick down Cirque trackpad
- Soldering tools

## Steps

### Firmware

It's a good idea to flash both RP2040-Zero to ensure they aren't dead

- Install [QMK CLI](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_cli)
- Git clone my [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/dlip/qmk_firmware/tree/dlip/keyboards/harite)

```
git clone https://github.com/dlip/qmk_firmware.git
cd qmk_firmware
```

- Hold the boot button while connecting the RP2040-Zero and a new drive should appear
- Flash the left

```
qmk flash -kb harite -km default -bl uf2-split-left
```

- Flash the right

```
qmk flash -kb harite -km default -bl uf2-split-right
```

### Soldering USB Port

![USB Port](images/usb-port.jpg)

- Since its quite challenging, solder on the usb ports on both sides. Watch this [YouTube video on drag soldering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uguPxmkmaSg&t=163s&ab_channel=OffTheClack) for tips.
- Test the connections with a multimeter: set it to continuity mode and ensure you only hear a beep when connecting the following pairs by testing one of the pairs against every other pin.

### Soldering RP2040-Zero

![RP2040-Zero with headers](images/rp2040-headers.jpg)

- If the legs on the on the headers are longer than 3mm you will need to cut them shorter.

![Cut Headers](images/cut-headers.jpg)

- Insert into the top of the pcb and slide RP2040-Zero onto it to ensure the legs are straight. You can use sticky tape on the top to hold it in place.

![RP2040-Zero Taped](images/rp2040-tape.jpg)

- Flip the board to solder the bottom side, then remove the tape and solder the top side.

### Test Connection Between Halves

- IMPORTANT: You must never connect or disconnect the halves while they are connected to the computer since it may cause a power surge and fry some components.
- Run `qmk console`
- Connect halves via USB-C cable
- Connect either half's RP2040-Zero to the computer
- If you see "Target connected" in the console after a few retries you are good to continue

```

```

### Soldering 5 Way Switches and Diodes

- Be careful with the switch orientation: the side with the 'v' shape cutout goes at the top, relative to the PCB's switch label (north east for the left side and north west for the right side)

![Switch Orientation](images/switch-orientation.jpg)

- Be careful with the diode orientation: the side with the line on the diode goes at the tip of the arrow on the PCB's label

![Diode Orientation](images/diode-orientation.jpg)

- Prepare each set of pads by soldering one of its pads

![Switches Solder Prep](images/switches-solder-prep.jpg)

- Solder the first pad of each component. Ensure they are all aligned to the other pads then solder the rest of them.

![Switches Complete](images/switches-complete.jpg)

- Test the 5 way switches are working by connecting this half to the PC via the RP2040-Zero with the USB cable and pressing each direction then its center switch. You should see these characters typed for each direction: 'u', 'd', 'l', 'r', 'c'

### Soldering Cirque Trackpad

- Note: in my photos I soldered the wires on the front side. I realised afterwards that it might have been easier to do it on the back, so I have added the labels there in the latest design. There should be enough room with the 3mm stand-offs to do it from the back but it would be great if someone could try this and let me know, I would like to make it the preferred method. Photos would be appreciated too!
- Prepare wires and strip one end of each to about 2mm and bending it 90 degrees. Keep the wires a bit longer than needed as we will cut it to length afterwards. It's good to use different coloured wires to help keep track of what goes where.
- Insert wires into the labeled cirque holes and solder on the opposite side

![Cirque Wires](images/cirque-wires.jpg)

- The Cirque orientation is different for each side, ensure the 2 cutouts point towards the RP2040-Zero

![Cirque Orientation](images/cirque-orientation.jpg)

- In order to ensure the wires are the correct length to allow enough slack to fit through the case in the end, I recommend taping it and the PCB to the case while soldering. I messed this part up many times, trust me its worth the effort.

![Cirque Taped](images/cirque-tape.jpg)

- Add solder to each of the 6 pads on the Cirque
- Cut each wire to length, ensuring plenty of slack by curving it down then up as in the image
- Strip each end and bend it 90 degrees

![Cirque Soldered](images/cirque-soldered.jpg)

- Connect to the computer and test you can move the cursor
- Remove the tape and carefully push the Cirque through the slit in the case. Try not to bend the the wires connecting to the Cirque, its better to bend at the PCB side since they have a stronger weld

### Case

- Melt knurled insert nuts into holes in the base and top. Heat soldering iron to about 170c temperature and melt while holding the nut down with tweezers to ensure its level

![melt-nuts.jpg](images/melt-nuts.jpg)

- Screw the PCB to the 3D printed base using the M2 4mm screws

![PCB Screwed](images/pcb-screwed.jpg)

- Put the 3D printed top over the top while carefully feeding the Cirque trackpad through the slit and into position, following the 2 notches to ensure it has the correct rotation

![Cirque Bend](images/cirque-bend.jpg)

- Add some Blu-tack or similar to keep it from coming out

![Cirque Blu-tack](images/cirque-blutak.jpg)

- Add joysticks

![Joysticks](images/joysticks.jpg)

- Test everything is still working on the computer
- Repeat the process on the other side

### Finish Line

- Flash my [QMK engram layout](https://github.com/dlip/qmk_firmware/tree/dlip/keyboards/harite/keymaps/engram) to the RP2040-Zero or make your own
- Play [Eye of the tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiIkBT-HFOA&ab_channel=n1ckr1vers) and start your training. Good luck!

# Harite Keyboard (WIP)

Harite is 5-way switch keyboard with dual trackpads. The word Harite is Sumo Slap attack in Japanese, I thought it was appropriate since it looks like a grabbing hand with the 5 joysticks for each finger and the trackpad as the palm.

## BOM

- 5 x M2 5mm flat head screws for base
